Car Rental Company Backend Application
Project Description
This project is a backend application developed using Java and the Spring Framework for a car rental company. The backend provides robust and scalable services to manage car reservations, user interactions, and administrative tasks, utilizing a MySQL database for persistent storage.

User Features:
Car Reservation:

Users can search for available cars and make reservations for specific time periods.
The backend handles the booking process, ensuring that cars are available and updating the reservation status accordingly.
Booking History:

Users can retrieve their booking history, including detailed information on each reservation such as car details, rental dates, and reservation status.
Refund Request:

Users can submit refund requests for their reservations through the application.
The backend processes these requests, updating the reservation status and initiating refund procedures.
User Management:

Users can update their profile information and manage their account settings.
Authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure that user data is secure and accessible only to authorized individuals.
Admin Features:
Data Management:

Administrators can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the car inventory, reservations, and user records.
The backend provides endpoints for managing the entire lifecycle of cars, from adding new cars to retiring old ones.
Analytics and Reporting:

The backend generates data reports and statistics, providing insights into reservation trends, fleet utilization, and user activities.
Administrators can access this data through endpoints that return analytical information in various formats.
Technologies Used:
Java: The primary programming language for developing robust backend services.
Spring Framework: Utilized for building scalable and maintainable enterprise-level applications.
Spring Boot: For rapid application development and simplified configuration.
Spring Data JPA: For simplifying database access and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with MySQL.
Spring Security: To handle authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to resources.
MySQL: The relational database used for storing and managing application data.
RESTful API: Designed to provide clear and structured endpoints for client applications to interact with the backend services.
Key Functionalities:
Authentication & Authorization: Secure user authentication and role-based access control for different endpoints.
Reservation Management: Endpoints for creating, updating, and canceling car reservations.
User Management: Services for managing user accounts, profiles, and access permissions.
Admin Dashboard: Endpoints providing comprehensive data and analytics for administrative tasks and decision-making.
This backend project aims to provide a reliable and efficient foundation for a car rental company's operations, supporting both user interactions and administrative management with a focus on security and scalability.
